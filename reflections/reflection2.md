Pod Members: Kelechi, Melyssa, Tom

## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 Deployment 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Webscrapping(populating the database with the webscrapped data), 
 Cutting down some features
 Testing
 Debugging 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes If advices count as ressources then i would say the advice we found most particularly helpful was getting help! The task we needed more support on was testing 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 As a student I should see a personalized feed of volunteer opportunities that align with my skillset/interests.
   This is largely because we have not populated our database, by monday(our next demo) it would be fixed!
